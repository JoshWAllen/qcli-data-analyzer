# Queen's Brainwaves

Try it yourself: [QCLI-data-analyzer](https://qcli-data-analyzer.vercel.app/)

Queen's Cerebral Language Innovation (QCLI) is a team of ambitious students at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) who are working to harness the power of brainwaves for real world applications by leveraging non-invasive EEG technologies.

QCLI Data Analyzer was originally a webapp tool to help the team make sense of complex EEG data recordings. After using the tool for in-house solutions, the team realized that the lack of accessible software could be a barrier to entry for many other eager students and hobbyists, and thus decided to extend the webapp to fit the general use case of beginners in the neuroscience field.

Although the team will continue to develop tailored software to support our own projects, a great effort will be made to release and maintain this free and beginner friendly tooling to the public.

Currently supporting the [Muse EEG](https://choosemuse.com/)
